/**
 * [LocalMapSquareZone] represents a local 8x8 zone index within a single 64x64 map square.
 *
 * The index is packed into an integer using three components:
 * - `x`: The zone X index in the map square, ranging from 0 to 7.
 * - `z`: The zone Z index in the map square, ranging from 0 to 7.
 * - `level`: The level or height coordinate, ranging from 0 to 3.
 *
 * This class is **not** semantically equivalent to `ZoneGrid`, which represents a coordinate within
 * a single 8x8 zone. In contrast, [LocalMapSquareZone] refers to which zone is being addressed
 * within a map square.
 *
 * @property packed The packed integer representation of the zone index within a 64x64 map square.
